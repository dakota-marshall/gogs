# gogs

An API wrapper library for the Go server [https://online-go.com/](https://online-go.com/) written in... Go.

This is a WIP reimplementation of my [Python-OGS](https://gitlab.com/dakota.marshall/ogs-python/-/blob/main/src/ogsapi/ogsrestapi.py?ref_type=heads) library.

I am using Bruno to document the OGS API, as its official documentation is lacking.


## Current To-Do List:

- [ ] Implement the core server class to handle the actual API calls
- [ ] Implement the basic REST API calls 
- [ ] Figure out how to re-implement the Socket.io API in Go
